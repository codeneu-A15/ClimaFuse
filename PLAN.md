# ClimaFuse — Development Plan & Roadmap

## 1. Project Overview
ClimaFuse is a high-precision, technical meteorological intelligence platform that fuses NOAA physics-based numerical weather prediction (GFS) with deep learning neural models (AIFS) via adaptive Bayesian Model Averaging (BMA) — weights vary by region, season, and lead time instead of being fixed. Ground truth calibration is driven by 800+ India Meteorological Department (IMD) Automatic Weather Stations (AWS).

---

## 2. Stack
- **Framework**: React (Vite)
- **Routing**: React Router v6.4+ — Data APIs (`createBrowserRouter`, `RouterProvider`, supporting loaders, defer(not required in v7 so not here), Await, Suspense)
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS v4 (via `@tailwindcss/vite` plugin, `@import "tailwindcss"` in `src/index.css`)
- **Geospatial / Map**: MapLibre GL JS — static India GeoJSON boundary, no tile provider/API key required
- **Data Visualization**: Recharts — all timeseries and model comparison charts
- **Utilities**: date-fns (date handling), react-day-picker (calendar UI), lucide-react & Material Symbols (icons), axios (configured for API endpoints)
- **Design Source**: Stitch (Project `projects/17717170675868708570`)

- [x] Corrected station coordinates in [`/src/api/cities.js`](file:///c:/Users/neera/OneDrive/Desktop/ClimaFuse/Climafuse/src/api/cities.js) (shifted Chennai, Mumbai, Kolkata inland onto landmass, resolving ocean placement)
- [x] Fixed MapLibre `load` event lifecycle in [`src/components/MapComponent.jsx`](file:///c:/Users/neera/OneDrive/Desktop/ClimaFuse/Climafuse/src/components/MapComponent.jsx) to reliably render Thermal, Precipitation, and Heat Index heatmaps with glowing observation points and gradient scale legend
- [x] Resolved MapLibre GL v6 Web Worker deployment issue by importing `maplibre-gl-worker.mjs?worker&url` and registering `setWorkerUrl(workerUrl)` across entrypoints, fixing `Worker failed to load (text/html strict MIME)` and ensuring all GeoJSON heatmap & vector layers render cleanly
- [x] Migrated national boundary GeoJSON to in-memory module [`src/api/indiaBoundary.js`](file:///c:/Users/neera/OneDrive/Desktop/ClimaFuse/Climafuse/src/api/indiaBoundary.js) (`INDIA_GEOJSON`) to eliminate asynchronous network fetch race conditions in production
